    "\n",
    "PageRank is a way to rank importance of nodes in a network.  By modeling the transition within a network as a Markov process, PageRank can be derived by finding the left eigenvector of the transition matrix, which can be interpreted as the steady-state probability of each node.  Nodes with higher steady-state probability is therefore ranked higher.  In the context of web search, the 'transition' can be interpreted as a person surfing among many webpages, and the resulting steady-state probability is the probability of the surfer visiting a specific page.  In addition, the algorithm needs the following modifications before applying to webgraphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Redistribution of weights from dangling nodes (nodes with no outlinks).  This is to ensure total probabilities sum up to one.\n",
    "- Teleportation: This is a small probability that a user would randomly jump to another webpage rather than via following a link."
